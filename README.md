# Keylogger-Malware-Project
A guide to building basic malware in Python by implementing a keylogger application.

### Purpose of the Project
This repository is made for the purpose of learning how basic malware can be created, obfuscated, and then deobfuscated for malware analysis. Through this repository, a fully working keylogger with the ability to exfiltrate data as well as persist on host machines will be presented.  In addition to this, it will be shown how to bypass Windows Defender, a native Windows anti-virus software.

### Disclaimer
This repository is soley presented for the sake of learning.  Do not use anything from this repository for malicous purposes. Replication of this repository for malicous use on a computer or system that you do not own is **strictly prohibited!**


## Building a Working Version of the Keylogger

### Installing Python and the Pynput Module
The first step is to download the Python programming language on to your computer. The link to the python download page is [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Select Windows, Linux/UNIX or macOS and download the latest version of Python. Note: When installing Python make sure to add to PATH.
